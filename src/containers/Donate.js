          <p>Hi guys, Welcome to F10K stats.</p>
          <p>
            This site was initially started just as a side project of me doing
            it in my free time, with no UI and functions as it is currently now.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have been spending a lot of time developing the web version for
            the program, integrating new features that we think will help you
            guys making easier choice in betting dota/csgo matches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using information we provide by no means will secure your bets, but
            at least we do HOPE that it help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please do come back again if you find the site helpful, share the
            site to your friends if you started winning bets, provide feedbacks
            so we can make it better.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also accepting donation in the form of items/ rolls. You can
            leave the roll information/ feedback for functions that you would
            LOVE to have in the below textbox.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks and good luck!</p>
